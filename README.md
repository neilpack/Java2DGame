# Java2DGame
Welcome to an individual project I started in September of 2025. It is a 2D adventure game made in Java!
I have always wanted to do one of these, and Java feels so old, which would really be a challenge for me.

Feel free to play the game for yourself and tell me what you think!

To play, you currently need to download a Java IDE and run the repository through that. When the game is finished,
there will be an easy way to start playing the game.
