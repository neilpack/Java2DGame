# Java2DGame
Welcome to an individual project I started in September of 2025. It is a 2D adventure game made in Java!
I have always wanted to do one of these, since Java was used to make so many of my favorite games.
I did not know how to code in Java before this project, so all of this is me practicing and learning the language.

You can download and play the game here: https://github.com/neilpack/Java2DGame/blob/main/JavaGame.jar

To run the .JAR file, you will need a JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
You can find one here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
